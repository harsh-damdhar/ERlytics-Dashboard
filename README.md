# 📊 ERlytics-Dashboard
ERlytics is a dynamic Excel-based dashboard designed to analyze and visualize emergency room (ER) data for better healthcare insights. This project demonstrates how Excel can be used as a powerful tool for healthcare data analytics, enabling quick decision-making through intuitive charts, KPIs, and trend analysis.

## 🏥 Project Overview
This Excel-based analytics dashboard is designed to support healthcare administrators and emergency room (ER) staff in monitoring, analyzing, and improving performance within the hospital emergency department. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard enhances visibility into key operational metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and improved patient outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Monitor ER performance** in real time through visual insights.
- **Identify bottlenecks** in patient flow and resource utilization.
- **Track key KPIs** to support quality improvement and strategic planning.
- **Enable forecasting** and capacity planning based on historical trends.
- **Improve patient care delivery** by reducing wait times and optimizing throughput.
  
## ⚙️ Process Workflow
   - Collect historical and real-time ER data from hospital systems.
   - Clean, de-duplicate, and format raw data in Excel.
   - Create structured tables (using Excel Tables) for time-series and categorical analysis.
   - Use PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and formulas to build interactive views.
   - Employ Conditional Formatting for visual alerts.
   - Design intuitive charts (bar, line, pie, gauge) for quick understanding.
   - Use Excel slicers and drop-downs for filtering by age group, date, year, gender.
     
## 📌 Dashboard Features

- **Interactive Filters:** Filter data by date, age group, year.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualize patterns in ER visits, wait times on monthly basis or day basis.
- **Heatmaps:** Identify high-load periods and bottlenecks.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel 2019 or later (Power Query and Power Pivot features)
- Raw ER data in structured Excel/CSV format
- Basic familiarity with Excel functions and PivotTables

## Conclusion
The Hospital Emergency Room Data Analytics Dashboard serves as a powerful, Excel-based decision-support tool for healthcare administrators and frontline teams. By transforming raw emergency department data into clear, actionable insights, the dashboard helps identify operational inefficiencies, track clinical performance, and improve patient care delivery.
