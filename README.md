## Process Workflow
   - Collect historical and real-time ER data from hospital systems.
   - Clean, de-duplicate, and format raw data in Excel.
   - Create structured tables (using Excel Tables) for time-series and categorical analysis.
   - Use PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and formulas to build interactive views.
   - Employ Conditional Formatting for visual alerts.
   - Design intuitive charts (bar, line, pie, gauge) for quick understanding.
   - Use Excel slicers and drop-downs for filtering by age group, date, year, gender.
     
## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel 2019 or later (Power Query and Power Pivot features)
- Raw ER data in structured Excel/CSV format
- Basic familiarity with Excel functions and PivotTables

## Conclusion
The Hospital Emergency Room Data Analytics Dashboard serves as a powerful, Excel-based decision-support tool for healthcare administrators and frontline teams. By transforming raw emergency department data into clear, actionable insights, the dashboard helps identify operational inefficiencies, track clinical performance, and improve patient care delivery.
